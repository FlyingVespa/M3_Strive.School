      Create a function to check from two given integers, whether one is positive and another one is negative.
      <br/>

- [x] **16.**
      Create a function to create new string with first 3 characters are in lower case and the others in upper case. If the string length is less than 3 convert all the characters in upper case.
      <br/>

- [x] **17.**
      Create a function to calculate the sum of the two given integers, If the sum is in the range 50..80 return 65 other wise return 80.
      <br/>

- [x] **18.**
      Create a function to convert a number to a string, the contents of which depend on the number's factors. Follow next example:

```If the number has 3 as a factor, output 'Diego'.
If the number has 5 as a factor, output 'Riccardo'.
If the number has 7 as a factor, output 'Stefano'.
If the number does not have 3, 5, or 7 as a factor, just pass the number's digits straight through.
Examples
28's factors are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28.
this would be a simple "Stefano".
30's factors are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30.
this would be a "DiegoRiccardo".
34 has four factors: 1, 2, 17, and 34.
this would be "34".
```

<br/>

- [ ] **19.**
      Create a function that given a phrase returns its acronym, like British Broadcasting Corporation returns BBC

- [ ] **1. MAX CHAR**
      Given a string, return the character that is most
      commonly used in the string.

```
--- Examples
    maxChar("abcccccccd") === "c"
    maxChar("apple 1231111") === "1"
```

- [ ] **2. ANAGRAMS**
      Check to see if two provided strings are anagrams of each other.
      One string is an anagram of another if it uses the same characters
      in the same quantity. Only consider characters, not spaces
      or punctuation. Consider capital letters to be the same as lower case

```
--- Examples
  anagrams('rail safety', 'fairy tales') --> True
  anagrams('RAIL! SAFETY!', 'fairy tales') --> True
  anagrams('Hi there', 'Bye there') --> False
```

- [ ] **3. ANAGRAMS 2**
      Given a word and a list of possible anagrams, select the correct sublist.

```
--- Examples
    "listen" and a list of candidates like "enlists" "google" "inlets" "banana" the program should return a list containing "inlets".
```

- [ ] **4. PALINDROME**
      Given a string, return true if the string is a palindrome
      or false if it is not. Palindromes are strings that
      form the same word if it is reversed. Do include spaces
      and punctuation in determining if the string is a palindrome.

```
--- Examples:

    palindrome("abba") === true
    palindrome("abcdefg") === false
```

- [ ] **5. REVERSE INT**
      Given an integer, return an integer that is the reverse
      ordering of numbers.

--- Examples

    reverseInt(15) === 51
    reverseInt(981) === 189
    reverseInt(500) === 5
    reverseInt(-15) === -51
    reverseInt(-90) === -9

- [ ] **6. STEPS**
      Write a function that accepts a positive number N.
      The function should console log a step shape
      with N levels using the # character. Make sure the
      step has spaces on the right hand side!

```
--- Examples

    steps(2)
        '# '
        '##'
    steps(3)
        '#  '
        '## '
        '###'
    steps(4)
        '#   '
        '##  '
        '### '
        '####'
```

- [ ] **7. REVERSE STRING**
      Given a string, return a new string with the reversed
      order of characters

```
--- Examples

    reverse('apple') === 'leppa'
    reverse('hello') === 'olleh'
    reverse('Greetings!') === '!sgniteerG'
```

- [ ] **8. CHUNK**
      Given an array and chunk size, divide the array into many subarrays
      where each subarray is of length size

```
--- Examples

    chunk([1, 2, 3, 4], 2) --> [[ 1, 2], [3, 4]]
    chunk([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2) --> [[ 1, 2], [3, 4], [5]]
    chunk([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], 3) --> [[ 1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8]]
    chunk([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 4) --> [[ 1, 2, 3, 4], [5]]
    chunk([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 10) --> [[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]]
```

- [ ] **9. PYRAMID**
      Write a function that accepts a positive number N.
      The function should console log a pyramid shape
      with N levels using the # character. Make sure the
      pyramid has spaces on both the left and right hand sides

```
--- Examples

    pyramid(1)
        '#'
    pyramid(2)
        ' # '
        '###'
    pyramid(3)
        '  #  '
        ' ### '
        '#####' */
```

- [ ] **10. SPYRAL MATRIX**

Write a function that accepts an integer N
and returns a NxN spiral matrix.

```
--- Examples

    matrix(2)
        [[1, 2],
        [4, 3]]
    matrix(3)
        [[1, 2, 3],
        [8, 9, 4],
        [7, 6, 5]]
    matrix(4)
        [[1, 2, 3, 4],
        [12, 13, 14, 5],
        [11, 16, 15, 6],
        [10,  9,  8, 7]]
```
